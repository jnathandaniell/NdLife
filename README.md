<h1>Description</h1>

Conway's Game of Life is a great way to learn some basic programming skills, and has some neat concepts associated with it.

Originally implemented in 2 dimensions, other implementations of it in 3 dimensions have been created. However, in theory, an N dimensional game of life could be created. This project aims to generalize the game of life to N dimensions, and be able to extract information from it.

<h2>Features</h2>


<ul>
  <li></li>Generalized ruleset creation (assuming the number of neighbors exist as a step function)</li>
  <li>Element-wise calculation (because I'm not that great at programming)</li>
  <li>Stable and semi-stable structure search</li>
  <li>Runtape</li>
</ul>

To be honest, I've been slowly losing my sanity and I think this project is part of it.

Also be careful with number of dimensions and size, because it gets very expensive very quickly.
